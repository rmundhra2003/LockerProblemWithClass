"#LockerProblemWithClass
 * Program to simulate the following experiment. You have 100 closed lockers.
 * Start with the first locker and for every locker open it. Now, starting with the second locker, for this locker and
 * every second locker after that, if the locker is open, close it; if it is closed, open it. Then, starting with the
 * third locker, for this locker and every third locker after that, if the locker is open, close it; if it is closed,
 * open it. Continue with the nth locker changing the “position” of every nth locker until n = 100.
 * Program prints out the locker numbers that remain open.
 * What do you notice about the lockers that remain open?
 * All the squares i.e. 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 remain open hence it follows a pattern
